Having spent the last 4+ years at a small artist management company in West Hollywood, dealing mainly in the hard rock world, I was almost always met with one of two responses when I explained that I had given notice and would be moving on. The first was, "Wow, that sounds really hard", and the second was "How did you decide to do that?" This decision was such a break from the norm, but for me it was the obvious path.

Artist management taught me more than I could have hoped for, throwing a new and different challenge at me every day. I learned quickly that I loved to create things. Whether it was a new record, webpage, merchandise bundle, or festival, I became absorbed in the project at hand, taking it from one stage to the next and ultimately getting to revel in the finished product, whatever that was. 

It got me thinking in an even bigger picture way. It is no secret that things are only continuing to move to our devices, including music culture. Through social media and streaming this has already happened in a big way, but the possibilities for what this could look like are infinite. I began wondering more and more what was feasible from a technical standpoint, and started teaching myself to code a bit in my free time in order to further understand the tools that were available. The more I learned, the more I was certain that I needed to know more. After several months of this I finally took the leap, and I am beyond thrilled that I did.
